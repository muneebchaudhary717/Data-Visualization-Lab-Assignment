# Data-Visualization-Lab-Assignment
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset using R and R Markdown. Twenty different visualizations were created to explore passenger demographics and survival patterns. The analysis shows that gender and passenger class significantly influenced survival, with females and first-class passengers having higher survival rates.
# Titanic Data Visualization Project

## 📌 Overview
This project is part of the Data Visualization Lab (DS-322). The objective of this assignment was to explore the Titanic dataset and create 20 different visualizations using R.

The project demonstrates skills in:
- Data cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical visualization
- Interpretation of graphical insights
- Report generation using R Markdown

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used is the Titanic Dataset, which contains passenger information such as:
- Survival status
- Passenger class
- Age
- Gender
- Fare
- Embarkation port

## 📈 Visualizations Included
This project includes 20 different visualizations such as:

- Bar Charts
- Stacked Bar Charts
- Pie Chart
- Histogram
- Density Plot
- Box Plot
- Violin Plot
- Scatter Plot
- Bubble Plot
- Line Chart
- Area Chart
- Correlation Heatmap
- Word Cloud
- Mosaic Plot
- Treemap
- Pair Plot
- Radar Chart

Each visualization includes:
- Clear title
- Proper axis labels
- Written interpretation

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- R Programming

- ggplot2
- dplyr
- corrplot
- wordcloud
- R Markdown

## 📄 Output
The final submission is generated as a PDF report using R Markdown.

## 🎯 Key Insights
- Gender and passenger class significantly influenced survival rates.
- Female passengers had higher survival probability.
- First-class passengers paid higher fares and had better survival rates.
- Most passengers were between 20–40 years old.
